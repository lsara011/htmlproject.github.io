    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p class="htmlex">HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage.
    <br>HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language used for creating the
      <br>structure and content of web pages on the World Wide Web.
      <br>It serves as the backbone of every web page, defining the various elements and their relationships.
      <br>HTML uses a tag-based system where elements are represented by opening and closing tags.
      <br>Each tag describes the purpose and meaning of the content it surrounds.
      <br>For example, the '< br >' tag is used to create line breaks within paragraphs or other block-level elements.
      <br>
      <br> HTML provides a wide range of tags to define headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links, tables, forms, and more.
      <br>By organizing content into these structural elements, HTML enables browsers to render web pages accurately and ensures accessibility for users and search engines.
      <br><br> HTML is a foundational language for web development, working together with CSS and JavaScript to create engaging and interactive websites.
    <br>All elements are enclosed within brackets <></p>

      </tr>
      <tr>

        <td>&lt;a&gt;</td>
        <td>Creates a hyperlink</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&lt;div&gt;</td>
        <td>Defines a division or section</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&lt;span&gt;</td>
        <td>Used for grouping inline elements</td>

  <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
  <p class="cssex">CSS is a programming language used to style the web pages. CSS Stands for <strong>C</strong>ascade <strong>S</strong>tyle <strong>S</strong>heets
  <br>The language is a fundamental component of web development used to define the visual presentation and layout of HTML elements on a web page.
    <br>It is a language that works alongside HTML and allows web designers and developers to apply styles, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning, to HTML elements.
    <br>With CSS, you can control the appearance of individual elements or apply styles globally to multiple elements.
    <br>CSS follows a cascading nature, where styles can be inherited from parent elements or overridden by more specific rules.
    <br>It provides a powerful set of selectors and properties that enable precise and flexible styling.
    <br>By separating the presentation layer (CSS) from the content layer (HTML),
    <br>CSS allows for efficient maintenance, consistency, and customization of web page designs, making it an essential tool for creating visually appealing and engaging websites.

    <h2>Okay so here's the thing...</h2>
    <p class="explanation">This was sorely a project for my class at first.<br>
      <STRONG>HOWEVER,</STRONG> these languages are great for someone looking to learn a language.
      <br>It is really straight forward and is not complicated unlike other languages.
      <br>There is a lot to learn from it but the more you learn the more you understand.
      <br>It can either be a great side hobby or it can land you a high salary job.
    <br>In Software Engineering, Front end developing is a branch of SE where the developers work on the face of the webpage.
    <br>Have you visited a webpage that is so beautiful that it can make you cry?</p>
    <h5>PS...Thank the developers(such as myself included :D Excuse but not sorry for the colors,<br> they're beautiful to me regardless if they're distasteful to you <3</h5>
